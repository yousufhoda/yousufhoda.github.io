        <h1>3 SEO Techniques</h1>

        <h2>1. Meta Descriptions</h2>
        <p>
            Meta descriptions are an HTML element that provides a brief description of a
            website. It’s displayed below the page title in the search engine results page
            (SERP) and acts as an introduction for the user to what’s on the webpage.
            While meta descriptions do not directly impact search rankings, they are crucial
            for improving click-through rates (CTR) by making your link appear more
            appealing in search results (Ellis & Martin, 2024).

        <h2>2. Header Tags</h2>
        <p>
            HTML header tags are essential for SEO as they help search engines understand
            the structure and importance of content on a website. The
            <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> tag carries the most weight for SEO, while subheadings
            like <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> organize content into
            sections, improving readability. Using relevant keywords in these tags can
            improve a page’s relevance to search queries, which can boost its ranking.
            Properly structured headers also make it easier to scan content, improving user
            experience and can indirectly increase engagement metrics that search engines
            consider for rankings (WooRank, n.d.).

        <h2>3. Alt Text</h2>
        <p>
            Alt text is a tool used in web development to describe the content and function
            of an image for users who cannot view it. This is particularly helpful for those
            with visual impairments who use screen readers to access web content. It’s also
            beneficial for SEO as search engines use it to understand the images on a
            website. To be effective, alt text should be descriptive yet concise. It should
            convey the primary meaning of the image or function to ensure an inclusive web
            experience for all users (Becker, 2018).

        <h1>3 SMO Techniques</h1>

        <h2>1. Hashtags</h2>
        <p>
            Hashtags are an important tool in social media optimization. They act as
            metadata tags that group content around specific topics, making it easier for
            users to find and engage with posts related to their interests. Adding hashtags
            to your posts increases your exposure by directing users to aggregated pages of
            posts with the same hashtag. When users click on a hashtag, they can explore
            more content related to that topic, increasing visibility and engagement
            (Global Print, 2024).

        <h2>2. Call-to-Action</h2>
        <p>
            A call-to-action (CTA) is an instruction to users that encourages them to take
            action, such as "Click here to learn more" or "Sign up for our email list".
            Including a CTA in your social media posts can increase web traffic and generate
            leads. By being direct and concise, a CTA engages users, prompting them to
            interact with the content and take the desired action (Bigwave Marketing, n.d.).

        <h2>3. Tracking Progress</h2>
        <p>
            Tracking your social media performance is vital for determining if your
            optimization efforts are effective. Monitoring metrics like post shares,
            comments, and likes provides insights into engagement levels, allowing you to
            adjust your strategy as needed. By using these analytics, you can optimize your
            social media strategy, ensuring better performance and improved
            ROI (Eclincher, 2024).
